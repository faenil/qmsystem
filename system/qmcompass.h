     * @brief Provides logical compass sensor.
     *
     * Logical compass sensor uses magnetometer and accelerometer to measure
     * current north angle.
     *
     * To get meaningfull direction from the compass, it must be calibrated.
     * Calibration level varies from 0 to 3. Only measurements at level 3
     * are accurate. Calibration is done by rotating the device around
     * each axis simultaneously. Rotating ones wrist for 2-3 rounds with
     * the device in hand usually is enough. Fast changes in the magnetic
     * environment may cause the calibration level to drop.
     * 
     * To get measurements and change sensor settings, the client must
     * open a session (and call start() for data). Details can be found
     * from documentation of #QmSensor.
