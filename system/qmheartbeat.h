 * @class QmHeartbeat
 * @brief QmHeartbeat Provides system heartbeat service.
 * @details System heartbeat is a service for applications to synchronize their
 * activity to save battery use time. 
 * <br>
 * The main idea is that applications that must do periodic activity – after being
 * in sleep a certain period – do that at the same time: for example 
 * send network “alive” messages at the same time (i.e. turn the wireless radio on 
 * at the same time). 
 * <br>
 * The service is not only for network-aware applications: in fact it must be used 
 * by any applications that need to periodic wake-ups.
